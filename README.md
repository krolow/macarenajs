# Macarena


> I'm just to lazy to start another node.js project from scratch, and I miss that productive felling that I had when using rails/cakephp.
> Macarena aims to solve my problem that maybe is yours as well.


### Objectives

- To not think to much to just code;
- It wont be a silver bullet, its to write API;
- It should know how to handle different things, but normally projects are quite similar so it define a happy path;
- Focus in small business logic, if it's big maybe can be more than one API?;
- Reuse as much as possible from other repositories, why recreate?
